# Hamster-RoundUP

// A video game made as a class project to prototype with P5js. You control a kid on a bike to collect hamsters using a grab-a-tron 3000 to store them in a pocket dimension.  You gain points for each hamster collected.  You can run into them to bounce them forward because they are special genetically altered hamsters made of rubber.  If any hamsters fall off screen to the left, then the player loses a life.
// There are 3 levels in total increasing in difficulty.
